 # oascargo - The OpenAPI Specification for Go

This library provides a simple interface to the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for the Go language.

It is intended to be pronounced "Oh a Escargot" and is a play on the French dish "Escargot"  and that this is an OAS 
library (packaged, hint, hint... cargo) fo Go.

It is a direct application of the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html) and is intended to be an easy to use library for working with the OpenAPI Specification in Go.
